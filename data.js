    userinfo:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span style='color: orange; font-weight:900;'>Summary:</span> Ryomen Sukuna, is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses, Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon during the Heian Era but in truth he was a sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One. Sukuna is around 1000+ years old and was a human now incarnate using the boding of itadori as his host.",
    domain:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMalevolent Shrine (Fukuma Mizushi) is Sukuna's domain expansion.<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span style='color: orange; font-weight:900;'>Appearance:</span> Malevolent Shrine constructs an environment centered around a small, disfeatured Buddhist shrine that has been distorted to instead enshrine demons. It is surrounded by dark-colored water and horned, bull-like skulls on the ground. The roof also has horns coming out of it, along with human skulls that hang down from it. The four entrances to the shrine are formed by large, grotesque mouths, complete with humanlike teeth and tongues.",
    extra:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span style='color: orange; font-weight:900;'>Extra:</span> Sukuna has the ability to expand his domain without closing the barrier. This creates a binding vow due to allowing an escape route from the domain that enables him to expand the range of the guaranteed-hit up to a maximum radius of <span style='color: deepskyblue;'>200 meters</span>. Unlike other domains which operate with an outer shell and can be cancelled if destroyed, Malevolent Shrine cannot be destroyed because of the lack of an enclosed barrier. ",

    domaininfo:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span style='color: orange; font-weight:900;'>Ability:</span> Malevolent Shrine's guaranteed-hit ability can be made to relentlessly slash apart anything until nothing but dust remains of what has caught in the effective range, via Sukuna's two types of slashing attacks: Cleave and Dismantle, which only cease when the domain is disengaged or Sukuna is so badly injured he can not sustain the domain anymore. Sukuna can set which of the two attacks to use against specific types of targets, such as using <span style='color: deepskyblue;'>Dismantle</span> for inanimate objects and <span style='color: deepskyblue;'>Cleave</span> for subjects with cursed energy.",

    lore:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span style='color: orange; font-weight:900;'>Usage:</span> During his battle with Satoru Gojo, Sukuna expanded his domain a total of <span style='color: deepskyblue;'>three</span> times. As previously mentioned, Malevolent Shrine can equal Unlimited Void in a domain clash, but that is only the case inside a barrier.<br><br> Malevolent Shrine's range reached beyond Unlimited Void's barrier during the first clash of domains. With a domain's barrier being weak to attacks on its outer shell, Gojo's domain was crushed by Malevolent Shrine's slashing attacks and he was immediately struck by its can't-miss attack. <br><br>Later in the fight, Sukuna revealed that he can change the conditions of his domain with a binding vow, such as removing Malevolent Shrine's guaranteed-hit effect within Unlimited Void's effective area or narrowing down its effective range similar to when it was used in Shibuya in exchange for increased power to counter Gojo's Unlimited Void's reinforced outer shell, collapsing it a second time.",
